Schema Validations
==================

Schema Validations is a plugin that reads various constraints defined against
columns in your database and applies the closest matching rails validation.

Currently the plugin supports the following constraints:

  NOT NULL is converted to validates_presence_of
  Numbers are checked using validates_numericality_of (including :integer => true)
  String lengths are checked using validates_length_of
