= Schema Validations

Schema Validations is a plugin that reads various constraints defined against
columns in your database and applies the closest matching rails validation.
(Ala Dave Thomas' Keynote.)

Over and above installing the plugin, no further action is required for the
validations to take effect; the database schema constraints will be read and
applied as validations when your ActiveRecord model classes are loaded; just
like magic.

The plugin supports the following constraints:

* <code>NOT NULL</code> is converted to +validates_presence_of+ (including +belongs_to+ associations);
* Numbers are checked using +validates_numericality_of+ (including <code>:only_integer => true</code>);
* String lengths are checked using +validates_length_of+; and
* Single-column unique indexes are converted to +validates_uniqueness_of+.
